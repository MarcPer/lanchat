# Lanchat

Chat on the terminal over the local network.

> Tested only on Linux.

## Usage

Download the binary and run it:

```sh
./lanchat -u my_user
```

It automatically detects if there's already a running _Lanchat_ server in the local network and connects to it. If there isn't, the command starts one on port _6776_.
